Proof on concept
Based on MAME 0.78

Tested for OS X, linux, Wii, and Android (arm-v7a).

TODO:

* Better path management. For now all games must be placed in a folder named 'rom'. Other folders must be created manually in 'rom's parent directory. Their names can be found under the File I/O section of src/libretro/osd.c.
* Make sure all of the mkdir commands in makefile complete before any compiling starts.
* Lots more

Notes:

* Will have errors on 64-bit platforms.
* Will have errors on platforms without unaligned memory access support.
* When using concurrent building you may get an error that it can't create certain object files, just rerun make if it happens.
* To run on Wii's memory constraints some drivers in src/driver.c must be removed.
